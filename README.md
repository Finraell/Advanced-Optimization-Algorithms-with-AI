# Advanced Optimization Algorithms with AI

This repository contains the **scaffolding** for the “Advanced Optimization Algorithms with AI” platform.  The goal of this project is to deliver a secure, scalable web platform that allows data scientists, operations researchers and engineers to describe optimisation problems in natural language or structured JSON, automatically translate them into formal models, run multiple solver back‑ends, compare results and iterate.  An AI “formulation copilot” assists with model creation, auditing and solver selection.

## High‑level overview

* **Backend (API)** – Implemented using **FastAPI** with Python 3.11+.  It provides endpoints for translating natural language into optimisation models, uploading model versions, starting runs and retrieving results.  The API uses **Pydantic** for request/response validation and **SQLAlchemy** for persistence (not yet included in this skeleton).  The API is containerised via a lightweight Dockerfile and served with **Uvicorn**.

* **Frontend** – A **Next.js** application written in TypeScript.  The first page in this scaffold simply renders a placeholder landing page.  In a full implementation it would handle authentication, project/model/run management and visualise solver results and recommendations.  It uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling.

* **Workers** – Long‑running or heavy computations such as solving optimisation models should run in background tasks.  This scaffold includes a minimal Celery worker with a single placeholder task.  In production this would interact with the optimisation engine, schedule resources and write back results.

* **Infrastructure** – Terraform configuration defines a minimal module to provision cloud resources (left mostly blank for you to fill in).  Helm charts define a simple Kubernetes deployment for the API, frontend and worker services.  These files are templates you can extend with readiness probes, environment variables and autoscaling policies.

This scaffold is intended as a starting point for a production‑grade system.  It does **not** yet implement the full functionality described in the specification, but the directory structure and placeholder files will allow you to iteratively build out features such as the AI formulation copilot, model auditing, solver adapters, RBAC, observability and CI/CD pipelines.
